## 📦 Virtual Chests

**Virtual Chests** is a lightweight and powerful Paper plugin that gives server admins full control over who can access private, virtual chests.

Instead of cluttering the world with physical chests, players can securely store their items in **virtual chests** that only they can access. Admins control access through permissions, making this system both flexible and safe.

### ✨ Features

* 🔑 **Permission-based access** – Grant or restrict chest access with ease.
* 📂 **Private virtual storage** – No physical chest needed, items are safe from griefers.
* 🛠️ **Configurable** – Easily manage how many virtual chests players can access.
* 🤝 **Seamless integration** – Works with existing permission plugins (LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, etc.).
* 📜 **History & restore system** – View past chest states, preview snapshots, and restore older versions instantly.

### 🎮 Use Cases

* Reward donators with extra storage.
* Unlock additional chests as achievement rewards.
* Protect inventories without relying on claim plugins.
